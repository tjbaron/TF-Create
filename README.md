# TF Create

A web based vector graphics and animation application. Note this is currently a work in progress. This version is loosely based on a much more capable version I created in 2010, but was in need of a rewrite (a lot has changed since then).

Development of this new version has focused on WebGL and image effects so far. Features in the old version that need to be added include:

* Animation Timeline
* Scripting
* Inverse Kinematics
* Collision Detection
* User Account Features
* Saving
* Gradients
* 3D Object Importing

Below is a screenshot of the previous version. You can also see a video of it [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61GiFSsuVwo). My goal is to make this new version work similarly to the old version, but more streamlined and optimized for touch.
