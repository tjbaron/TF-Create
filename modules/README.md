# TF Create

TF Create is a vector graphics based web app. The core software is written to be lightweight and is the foundation we build various modules on top of. Each module is for work within a distinct industry. There are no "lite" and "pro" versions, or any other tiering system to confuse or nickel and dime you.

## Core

This is the core application that allows the creation of simple, static svg files. This version is free and is useful to evaluate our software and make an informed decision before purchasing any modules. It is also useful for creating logos or graphics for the web.

## Animation

The module is allows you to create 2D cartoon style videos! Support for cut-out and frame-by-frame animation is included. Export to image sequences which are easily converted to videos and imported into a large range of video editing software.

## Circuitry

Design circuit boards and export to the popular Gerber file format. Includes wire routing and other feature designed specifically for PCB (printed circuit board) design.

## Embroidery

Export DST and PES embroidery files. This module allows you to specify how we should generate each stitch based on your base vector art. Set parameters for our auto-generation, then tweak each individual stitch to your liking.

## Fashion

Design garments using our Fashion module. This module includes many advanced features that you may be familiar with, including grading. But, it also includes many unique features that you are unlikely to find in other software. Use 3D body scans to grade your pattern to an individual. Specify edges, seams, fit and more by drawing directly on a digital, 3D dress form (mannequin). Then have our software unwrap to a 2D pattern, automatically adding seam allowances and more.

## Apps

Create web based games and visualizations that have complex interactions. Write Javascript in our code editor that manipulates the graphics in your scenes. Attach scripts to scene objects and expose variables in the editor to allow non-programmers to create interactive content using your scripts. Export to a zip containing a simple webpage with your creation and everything you need to embed your creation on existing webpages.
